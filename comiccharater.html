            <h2>Toji Fushiguro</h2>
            <p>Toji Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ甚とう爾じ Fushiguro Tōji?), born Toji Zenin (禪ぜん院いん甚とう爾じ Zen'in Tōji?) is a recurring character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He was a former member of the Zenin clan and the infamous assassin known as the Sorcerer Killer (術じゅつ師し殺ごろし Jutsushi Goroshi?), contracted by the Time Vessel Association among other groups throughout his time as a non-curse user. He was also the father of Megumi Fushiguro and former enemy of Satoru Gojo..</p>
            <p><strong>Curse Technique:</strong>All sorcerers or curses with cursed energy will leave behind some residual energy that can help their enemies track them. However, since Toji is a special case, he can roam freely while being undetected by others. He can even move through barriers and sneak past Gojo’s Six Eyes. Compared to having cursed energy, Toji’s abilities are far superior.

                    <h2>Ryomen Sukuna</h2>
                    <p>Ryomen Sukuna (両りょう面めん宿すく儺な Ryōmen Sukuna?), more often referred to as simply Sukuna (宿すく儺な Sukuna?), is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer from over a thousand years ago. Regarded as the undisputed King of Curses (呪のろいの王おう Noroi no Ō?), Sukuna is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series.</p>
                    <p><strong>Curse Technique:</strong>Shrine (御み廚づ子し Mizushi?): Sukuna's cursed technique allows him to launch slashes at various ranges to cut through objects and space, as well as unleash destructive flames. </p>
                    <p><strong>DOMAIN:</strong>Malevolent Shrine (御み廚づ子し Mizushi?): Sukuna's domain expansion, Malevolent Shrine, is a powerful technique that creates a vast, dark space filled with cursed energy. </p>
                    <div class="character">
                        <img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2022/06/6bad1-16560878914133-1920.jpg" alt="Kenjaku">
                        <h2></h2>
                        <p>Kenjaku (羂けん索じゃく Kenjaku?) is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He was an ancient curse user who existed for over a thousand years using his innate technique, which allowed him to transplant his brain into other bodies and control them. He has inhabited different individuals throughout the centuries and assumed their identities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Curse Technique:</strong>Brain Transplant: Kenjaku's innate technique allows him to swap bodies with another person, even if they are dead, by transplanting his brain into the body of his target. After the transplant, this technique leaves a stitched scar running horizontally through the forehead, which he cannot heal as part of a binding vow.[74] By undoing the stitches, Kenjaku can remove the top part of his head to reveal his original brain. </p>
                        <p><strong>DOMAIN:</strong>Womb Profusion (胎蔵遍たいぞうへん野や Taizō Hen'ya?): Kenjaku's domain expansion takes the form of a giant pillar made up of cursed spirits. It is an open barrier type domain, similar to Malevolent Shrine.[82][83] The effect of this domain is unclear, though its guaranteed-hit severely injured Yuki Tsukumo, a special grade jujutsu sorcerer. </p>

                            <h2>Mahito</h2>
                            <p>Mahito (真ま人ひと Mahito?) is one of the primary antagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is an unregistered special grade cursed spirit allied with Pseudo-Geto. He is also the leader of his own group, consisting of Jogo, Hanami, and Dagon. His group's ultimate goal is the eradication of humanity and ultimately replacing the population with cursed spirits.</p>
                            <p><strong>Curse Technique:</strong>Idle Transfiguration (無む為い転てん変ぺん Mui Tenpen?): Mahito's cursed technique grants him the ability to reshape souls. Doing so allows him to disfigure the body of his victims, heal his own wounds, transform his appendages into weapons, and a variety of other possible transformations. Mahito can even create a clone that may use Idle Transfiguration on himself but not on others. </p>
                            <p><strong>DOMAIN:</strong>Self-Embodiment of Perfection (自じ閉へい円えん頓どん裹か Jihei Endonka?): Mahito's Domain Expansion creates an environment where he is automatically connected with the souls of anyone inside and is capable of transfiguring them at will.[3] His control over the technique is flexible enough that, much like Satoru Gojo, he is capable of activating it for 0.2 second intervals. </p>
